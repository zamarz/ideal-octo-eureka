This is the second version of my portfolio, built using Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase, React, and TypeScript. It serves to showcase my coding skills, both backend and frontend, as well as give people more of an insight into who I am.

## Getting Started

To create your own version, you'll need to set up a Firebase Firestore database by heading to your Google Cloud console and setting up a new project. This will generate your own API key and other secret information that you can store in an .env file.

To get up and running, fork or clone the repo, pull the code, and use npm -i (other commands available) to install all dependencies.

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

When you make changes to the files and save each file, the results, or error messages, should be displayed in your browser.
