          After covering the world of B2B tech as a writer, I decided to take
          the plunge and dive even deeper into the industry by becoming a
          software developer. This is something that has always fascinated me
          and I find it very satisfying to connect the pieces of the puzzle and
          understand how everything works, not only in the back-end but the
          front-end too. I'm always looking to learn new things and jump at the
          opportunity to try my hand at unfamiliar technologies.{" "}
